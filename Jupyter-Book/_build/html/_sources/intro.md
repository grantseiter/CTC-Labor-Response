The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 [(ARPA)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1319/text) temporarily expanded the child tax credit (CTC) for 2021 by allowing households to claim up to \$3,600 for each child under age six and \$3,000 for each child age six to seventeen. The credit was also made fully refundable and advanceable. 

We analyzed the impact of a permanent CTC expansion on employment using [Tax-Calculator](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator), an open-source microsimulation model of the federal individual income and payroll tax, along with an [employment model and set of assumptions](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/43674) from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). According to our calculation, the likely impact of the CTC expansion on employment will be 296,000 full-time equivalent jobs lost (+/- 155,000).

This document provides a technical description of the methodology and summarizes our results.
