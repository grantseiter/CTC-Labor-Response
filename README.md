### Note:

The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA) temporarily expanded the child tax credit (CTC) for 2021 by allowing households to claim up to $3,600 for each child under age six and $3,000 for each child age six to seventeen. The credit was also made fully refundable and advanceable.

We analyzed the impact of a permanent expansion on employment using Tax-Calculator, an open-source microsimulation model of the federal individual income and payroll tax, along with a method similar to the model and set of assumptions employed by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).
